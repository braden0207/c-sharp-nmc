//You are writing a program that will calculate a discount for shoppers based upon the
//pin number they enter. Create a new C# console application and name it Chapter3Ex1.
//2. The program should do the following:
//a) Welcome the user to the frequent shopper discount program
//b) Prompt the user for their 4 digit pin
//c) Read in the pin and use a nested if…else to determine the discount. The rules are as
//follows:
//pin numbers > 5000 receive a 20% discount
//pin numbers > 1000 receive a 15% discount
//pin numbers > 100 receive a 10% discount
//everyone else with a pin receives a 5% discount
//d) Prompt the user for the amount they spent
//e) Read in the amount spent and store the value.
//f) Calculate the total cost = amount spent – ( amount spent * discount)
//g) Write out the customer’s total cost using formatted output.
