//The program should do the following:
//a) Create bool variables for the early shift and late shift and initialize them to false.
//b) Create a variable for hours and initialize it to 40
//c) Create a variable for pay rate and initialize it to 50.
//d) Create a variable for salary and initialize it to 0.
//e) Ask the user if they work mornings (have them type ‘y’ if it is true, otherwise they
//should press any key).
//f) Use an if…else statement to check their answer. If it is true, set early shift to true. If
//it is false, set late shift to true.
//g) Use an if…else statement to check early shift to see if it is true. If it is true, calculate
//the salary = hours * pay rate. If it is false, calculate the salary = hours * pay rate +
//500.
//h) Display the hours worked and the salary to the user. Use string interpolation AND
//formatted output for the salary. (The formatted output is similar to what you did in
//Chapter 2 Exercise 1)
